# Most Wanted input scripts

Input scripts for runtime/autotest.c, served at `/tests/scripts/` by a server started with `--game mw --dev`
(see ../README.md).

Besides autotest.c's commands, Most Wanted's runs take `call ADDR [ecx=X] [ARG ...]` and `loadlib NAME`
(runtime/mw/debug_mw.c), both test-only.
